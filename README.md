Idea #1: Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, analyze metereological maps and graphs of areas affected by Diseasters at times before, during and after to be able to find patterns that will help in better predicting diseasters before they occur from the analysis of live weather maps by AI. 

Idea #2: Using Machine Learning and AI, make a system that can analyze strucures based on photos and other given data (age of structure, size, etc.) and give a judgement on the structural integrity of a structure and to reccommend what work needs to be done to improve the integrity of the structure based on the severity. This is to help in preventing structural failures during diseasters such as floods or hurricanes
