Idea #1: Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, analyze metereological maps and graphs of areas affected by Diseasters at times before, during and after to be able to find patterns that will help in better predicting diseasters before they occur from the analysis of live weather maps by AI. 
Via Machine Learning, the metereological maps will be examined. Patterns will hopefully be discovered, which were not known before. An AI Model can be trained to be able to match the patterns to a live metereological map to a certain threshold/accuracy. If a pattern match is found, live, then an intimation can be sent to the operator, signalling a potential diseaster. With further training and data identification, the system can predict the severity of the impending diseaster. Based on this, necessary precautions can be taken in to be affected areas
